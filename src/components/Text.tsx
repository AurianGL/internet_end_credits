    While the inflation of images is on an endless rise <br />
    And as I grew older <br />
    The doubt that once inhabited me <br />
    Born at the tip of my pencil <br />
    Kept growing <br />
    And the desire of being an artist <br />
    Could't keep up with the guilt of adding an image to the world
    <br />
    Slowly I started painting only for myself <br />
    The diagrams carrefully crafted into my pictures were no longer making as
    much sense if they were show to a random audience. <br />
    Or to an audience at all <br />
    <br />
    In the meantime <br />
    The overwhelming feeling of the disparition of images made itself more and
    more present <br />
    The condition of existence of images is bearly still existing <br />
    As the inexorable uncovering of meaning advance<br />
    The obviousness territories' get bigger and bigger <br />
    And nothing is to remain hidden <br />
